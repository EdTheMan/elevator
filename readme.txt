The way my program is set up is that the people who are inside the elevator have a higher priority than people that call the elevator. People that call the elevator will increment a variable to keep track that someone left needs the elevator. I think this way is good because we want to get people who are inside the elevator out as soon as possible. The elevator may pass by people who need the elevator on the way to the destination and pick them up. The person who directed the elevator last does have a higher advantage in where the elevator should go. However, this does make sense because we expect that people who have gotten on early have a higher chance of getting to their destinations already since the elevator will pass by floors. Especially since we only have five floors in this simulation, I feel that this simple algorthim can get people where they want in a mannered time. Unfortunately my code climate rating is not great because I used a lot of randomization to generate the people and floors. I also have a complex method for moving the elevator by one tick.
